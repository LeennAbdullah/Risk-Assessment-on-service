				Leen's Methodology.
it assigns for each asset weight from 1-30 based on the cost of ownership, cost on the
reputation and the impact on the mission:
		-if the asset cost less than 300$ per month then it is ranked between 1-4
		-if the asset cost less more than 1000 and less than 5000 then ranked between
		5-7, otherwise ranked between 8-10.

then creates the threat inventory and rank it in scale from 1-5 based on the following metrics:
	1-Finanial Loss.
	2-Reputational Loss.
	3-Cost to protect.
	4-The loss of the Competitive advantage.
	5-The frequency of occurence.

The Vulnerability inventory will specify the assets that it affects based on 
the threat that the existence of this vulnerability will cause. 
for example HTTP insecure connection protocol might cause unauthorized access. 

The likelihood is measured from 0.1  -  1.0
and the risk is measured quantitivly from ((likelihood*asset weight)-((likelihood*asset weight)*available controls)+((likelihood*asset weight)*uncertaininty))
Assumed that if there is a control if mitigates 20%
the risk appetite is 15 and less
